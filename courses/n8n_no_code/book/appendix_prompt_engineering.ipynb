    "You help with orders, returns, and product questions.\n",
    "Be friendly but concise.\n",
    "```\n",

    "- GENERAL\n",
    "\n",
    "Respond with ONLY the category name. No explanations.\n",

    "- email (string or null)\n",

    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Summarize support tickets in a standard format.\n",

    "Example 1:\n",
    "Input: \"I can't log in. I've tried resetting my password.\"\n",
