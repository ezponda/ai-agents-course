Instead of one prompt → one response, agents **loop**: they think, act, observe, and repeat until done. This changes how you write prompts.\n\nThis appendix covers:\n- How the agent loop works (and why it matters)\n- Writing tool descriptions that actually get used\n- A system prompt template you can copy\n\nRead Appendix D first—the basics still apply here."

Never calculate manually.\n- Wikipedia: Use for factual questions about people, places, events.\n\nThink before acting. Use tools when you need external information, and stop when the task is complete. Never invent facts. Keep answers under 5 sentences. If you're unsure, say so.\n```\n\n**What makes this work:**\n- Role and goal are explicit, like in Appendix D\n- Tool guidance tells the agent WHEN to use each one\n- \"Stop when complete\" prevents the agent from looping when it shouldn't\n- Constraints are specific, not vague (\"under 5 sentences\" vs \"be concise\")"
