    "## Option 1: Docker (Recommended)\n",
    "\n",
    "Docker provides a consistent environment across macOS, Windows, and Linux. This is the recommended approach for this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Install Docker\n",
    "\n",
    "Download and install Docker Desktop for your operating system:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **All platforms:** [docker.com/products/docker-desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)\n",
    "\n",

    "### Step 2: Run n8n\n",
    "\n",
    "Open your terminal (or PowerShell on Windows) and run:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "docker run -it --rm \\\n",
    "  --name n8n \\\n",
    "  -p 5678:5678 \\\n",

    "  docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n\n",
    "```\n",

    "**What this command does:**\n",
    "- Runs n8n in a container named `n8n`\n",
    "- Maps port 5678 so you can access the UI in your browser\n",
    "- Stores your data in a Docker volume called `n8n_data` (persists between runs)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Open n8n\n",
    "\n",
    "Open your browser and go to: **http://localhost:5678**\n",
