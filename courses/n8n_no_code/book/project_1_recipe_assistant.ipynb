You controlled every step.\n\nNow let's build an **agent** that does all of that by deciding for itself. It will search for real recipes on the internet, present them, and generate a shopping list with cost estimates — choosing which tools to use and in what order.\n\n| What you'll learn | Where it comes from |\n|-------------------|--------------------|\n| **HTTP Request Tool** | New — fetch live data from APIs |\n| **Sub-workflows as tools** | New — delegate tasks to specialist workflows |\n| **Agent orchestration** | Builds on agents (Ch 7) and tool calling (Ch 8) |\n\n**Workflows in this chapter:**\n\n| File | What it does | GitHub Link |\n|------|-------------|-------------|\n| `10a_shopping_list_agent.json` | Sub-workflow: generates shopping list + cost estimate | [View](https://github.com/ezponda/ai-agents-course/blob/main/courses/n8n_no_code/book/_static/workflows/10a_shopping_list_agent.json) |\n| `10b_recipe_assistant.json` | Orchestrator agent with HTTP search + sub-workflow tools | [View](https://github.com/ezponda/ai-agents-course/blob/main/courses/n8n_no_code/book/_static/workflows/10b_recipe_assistant.json) |\n\n**Credentials needed:** OpenRouter API key (Settings → Credentials).
