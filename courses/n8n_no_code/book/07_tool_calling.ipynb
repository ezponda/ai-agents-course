    "### When to Use MCP\n",
    "\n",
    "- You want to use tools from services like Notion, Slack, or custom APIs that provide MCP endpoints\n",
    "- You want to expose your n8n workflows as tools for Claude Desktop, Cursor, or other MCP clients\n",
    "- You're building a system where multiple AI applications share the same tools\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Connecting to an MCP Server\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Add **MCP Client Tool** as a sub-node to your AI Agent\n",
    "2. Configure the **SSE Endpoint** URL of the MCP server\n",
    "3. Set authentication if required\n",
    "4. Choose which tools to expose to the agent (All or Selected)\n",
