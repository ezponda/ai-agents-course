   "source": "---\n\n## How Tool Calling Works\n\nWhen you connect tools to an AI Agent node, you're giving the model a menu of capabilities. The model doesn't execute tools directly—it *requests* that a tool be called, and n8n executes it.\n\n### The Loop\n\nThis is the same agent loop from the First AI Agent chapter: **Reason → Call Tool → Observe → Repeat or Answer** (also called the **ReAct pattern**).\n\n1. **Reason** — The model reads the user's question and its available tools\n2. **Call Tool** — The model outputs which tool to call and with what inputs\n3. **Observe** — n8n executes the tool and returns the result to the model\n4. **Repeat or Answer** — The model decides if it needs more tools or can answer\n\n### Why It Matters\n\nThe model chooses tools based on:\n- The **tool name** and **description** you provide\n- The **user's question**\n- The **system message** instructions\n\nIf any of these are unclear, the model may call the wrong tool, call no tool, or hallucinate an answer instead of looking it up."

   "source": "---\n\n## How the Agent Picks a Tool\n\nWhen you connect tools to an AI Agent, n8n collects all their descriptions and sends them to the LLM. The model then decides which tool to use—you don't write \"if user asks X, use tool Y\" logic.\n\n**What the model uses to decide:**\n\n- **Tool descriptions** — What each tool does (the main signal)\n- **Tool names** — Short identifiers like `wikipedia`, `calculator`\n- **User's question** — What they're asking for\n- **System Message** — Extra rules you add (optional)\n\n### What a Tool Looks Like\n\nEvery tool has a name, a description, inputs, and outputs:\n\n| Part | Example (Wikipedia) |\n|------|---------------------|\n| **Name** | `wikipedia` |\n| **Description** | \"Search Wikipedia for factual information\" |\n| **Inputs** | `query` (string) |\n| **Outputs** | Article text or summary |\n\nThe **description** is the most important part—it tells the model when to use the tool.\n\n### Where Descriptions Come From\n\n| Tool type | Description | You write it? |\n|-----------|-------------|---------------|\n| Built-in (Wikipedia, Calculator) | Hardcoded in the node | No |\n| Custom (HTTP Request Tool, Workflow Tool) | Field in the tool's settings | Yes |\n\n```{tip}\nFor built-in tools, the descriptions are hidden in the code. n8n is open source, so you can see them: [n8n tool source code](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/%40n8n/nodes-langchain/nodes/tools).\n\nWikipedia's description is: *\"A tool for interacting with and fetching data from the Wikipedia API.\"*\n```\n\n### The System Message: Extra Rules, Not Descriptions\n\nThe System Message is for *additional rules*, not for describing tools. Use it when:\n\n- You want to prioritize one tool: *\"Always try Wikipedia first\"*\n- You need to limit usage: *\"Call each tool at most twice\"*\n- You want to prevent actions: *\"Never send emails without asking\"*\n\nIf your tools have clear descriptions, the agent will usually pick correctly without extra help."

If the agent calls them incorrectly, nothing bad happens—you just get wrong or irrelevant data.\n\n### Write Tools (Dangerous)\n\n- Send email\n- Create ticket\n- Update database\n- Post to social media\n- Delete file\n\nThese tools *change* something. If the agent calls them incorrectly, you could send embarrassing emails, create duplicate tickets, or lose data.\n\n### The Golden Rule\n\n> **If a tool changes something in the real world, it needs human approval before executing.**\n\n### Principle of Least Privilege\n\nGive agents only the tools they need:\n- A research assistant only needs read-only tools\n- A customer support agent might need write tools, but with approval gates\n\nStart minimal. Add more tools only when necessary.\n\n```{note}\n**What if you have many tools?**\n\nThis course uses 2-3 tools per agent. In production systems with 10+ tools, new challenges appear: the agent may pick the wrong tool, calls become slow and expensive, or tools from different domains interfere with each other.\n\nCommon solutions:\n- **Tool Search**: Retrieve only relevant tools per request (instead of loading all 50)\n- **Programmatic Tool Calling**: Agent writes code that calls multiple tools in batch, returns only the result\n- **Universal Code Runner**: One powerful Code node instead of many small tools (n8n's Code node is exactly this)\n- **Router → Specialists**: Split into multiple focused agents (e.g., Support Agent, Billing Agent) with isolated tool sets\n- **Tool Use Examples**: Add example calls inside tool descriptions to improve parameter accuracy\n\nFor implementation details, see [Anthropic's Advanced Tool Use](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/advanced-tool-use).\n```"

Click **Workflows** → **Add Workflow**\n2. Rename to \"Research Agent with Approval\"\n\n### Step 2: Add trigger and input\n\n1. Add **Manual Trigger**\n2. Add **Edit Fields** → rename to `Input — Research Topic`\n3. Add two fields:\n\n| Name | Value |\n|------|-------|\n| `topic` | `When was the Eiffel Tower built and how tall is it in feet?` |\n| `recipient` | `team@example.com` |\n\n### Step 3: Add the AI Agent\n\n1. Add **AI Agent** → rename to `Research Agent`\n2. Set **Prompt** (Expression mode):\n   ```\n   Research this topic and provide a brief summary (3-4 sentences):\n   \n   {{ $json.topic }}\n   \n   Use Wikipedia for facts. Use Calculator for any unit conversions.\n   ```\n3. Set **System Message**:\n   ```\n   You are a research assistant. Your job is to find accurate information.\n   \n   Rules:\n   - Use Wikipedia to look up facts. Do NOT guess.\n   - Use Calculator for any math or conversions.\n   - Call each tool at most twice. If you still can't find the answer, explain what you tried.\n   - Keep your summary brief: 3-4 sentences maximum.\n   - If you can't find information, say so clearly.\n   ```\n\n### Step 4: Connect sub-nodes to the Agent\n\n1. Add **OpenRouter Chat Model** (or your preferred provider) → connect to Agent\n2. Add **Wikipedia** tool → connect to Agent\n3. Add **Calculator** tool → connect to Agent\n\n### Step 5: Format the email draft\n\n1. Add **Edit Fields** → rename to `Format Email Draft`\n2.

Add **Wait** → rename to `Wait — Approval`\n2. Set **Resume**: `On Webhook Call`\n3. In Options, set **Webhook Suffix**: `{{ $execution.id }}`\n\n### Step 7: Add the output\n\n1. Add **Edit Fields** → rename to `Output — Approved`\n2. Add fields:\n\n| Name | Value (Expression) |\n|------|--------------------|\n| `email_to` | `{{ $node['Format Email Draft'].json.to }}` |\n| `email_subject` | `{{ $node['Format Email Draft'].json.subject }}` |\n| `email_body` | `{{ $node['Format Email Draft'].json.body }}` |\n| `status` | `approved` |\n| `approved_at` | `{{ $now.format('yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm') }}` |\n\n3. Enable **Keep Only Set**\n\n### Step 8: Test\n\n1. Click **Execute Workflow**\n2. Watch the agent use Wikipedia and Calculator\n3. See the draft email at \"Format Email Draft\"\n4.
