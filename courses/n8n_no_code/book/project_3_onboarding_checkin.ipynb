    "## What to Observe + Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "After running the three test cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Case 2 is why the agent exists**\n",
    "\n",
    "Without AI, a Switch on the dropdown sends \"Good\" to the happy path. The harassment concern goes unnoticed. The agent reads the free text and overrides. This is the difference between routing and classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. The agent outputs one word**\n",
    "\n",
    "The system prompt says \"Output ONLY one word\". This makes the Switch reliable — it matches an exact string. If the agent wrote a paragraph, the Switch couldn't route it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Clean Classification is a safety net**\n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs sometimes add whitespace or change capitalization. `$json.output.trim().toLowerCase()` handles this. The fallback output on the Switch catches anything else.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Form data is accessible everywhere**\n",
    "\n",
    "Even after the Switch, you can reference `$('Onboarding Check-in').item.json['Full name']`. This is how the Output nodes build personalized emails without passing every field through every node.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. The Output nodes are templates, not sent emails**\n",
    "\n",
    "The workflow prepares the email content (to, subject, body) but doesn't send it. This lets you inspect the output before connecting a real email service. See Challenge 1.\n",

    "## Try It Yourself\n",
    "\n",
    "### Challenge 1: Send Real Emails with Gmail\n",
    "\n",
    "Replace each Output Edit Fields node with a **Gmail** node (or **Send Email** node). Use your Google account credentials.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the `at_risk` branch, you need two Gmail nodes in sequence: one to the employee, one to the manager.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint:** The Gmail node has `To`, `Subject`, and `Message` fields. Use the same expressions from the Output nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Done when:** you receive a real email after submitting the form.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Challenge 2: Log to Google Sheets\n",
    "\n",
    "Add a **Google Sheets** node at the end of each branch. Append a row with: timestamp, name, department, week, rating, classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "All three branches connect to the same Google Sheets node. After a few test runs, open the Sheet and see the log.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint:** Use `{{ $now.toFormat('yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm') }}` for the timestamp. Follow the same pattern from the tips video (Prompt Chaining chapter).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Done when:** the Google Sheet has rows from all three classification types.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Challenge 3: Add Follow-up with Wait\n",
    "\n",
    "After the email in each branch, add a **Wait** node, then a second email reminding the employee to fill in their next check-in. Use different wait times:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Branch | Wait time (production) | Wait time (testing) |\n",
    "|--------|----------------------|--------------------|\n",
    "| on_track | 7 days | 1 minute |\n",
    "| needs_help | 3 days | 30 seconds |\n",
    "| at_risk | 1 day | 15 seconds |\n",
    "\n",
    "The follow-up email should include the Form Trigger's production URL so the employee can fill in the next check-in.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint:** The Wait node is covered in the Human-in-the-Loop chapter. Set it to `After time interval`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Done when:** you submit the form, receive the first email, wait, then receive a follow-up email with the form link.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Challenge 4: Upgrade to Agent with History\n",
    "\n",
    "Add a **Google Sheets Tool** to the agent so it can read previous check-ins for the same employee. Update the system prompt to check for trends:\n",
    "\n",
    "- \"If the employee has been Okay for 2+ consecutive weeks, classify as at_risk\"\n",
    "- \"If the employee improved from Bad to Good, mention it in a positive note\"\n",
    "\n",
    "This is what makes it a true agent (not just a chain) — it decides whether to use the tool based on context.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Done when:** an employee who submits \"Okay\" three weeks in a row gets classified as `at_risk` on the third submission."
