   "source": "# Quick Start: Your First AI Workflow\n\nIn this chapter, you will **build a working AI workflow from scratch**.\n\nNo importing files. No theory first. Just building.\n\n**The end result:** you type a topic and the AI explains it in simple words.\n\n> **You type:** `artificial intelligence`\n>\n> **The AI responds:** *\"Artificial intelligence is like teaching a computer to think and learn, kind of like how you learn new things at school. Imagine you have a really smart toy that can look at pictures and tell you if it sees a cat or a dog — that's AI!\"*\n\n**The workflow you will build:**\n\n```\n┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐\n│  Manual Trigger │────▶│   Edit Fields   │────▶│ Basic LLM Chain │\n└─────────────────┘     └─────────────────┘     └─────────────────┘\n  (start button)           (your topic)            (asks the AI)\n                                                    ┊ (sub-node)\n                                                    ┊\n                                              ┌───────────┐\n                                              │Chat Model │\n                                              └───────────┘\n                                              (AI provider)\n```\n\nThree nodes, three steps:\n1. **Manual Trigger** — starts the workflow when you click a button\n2. **Edit Fields** — creates the input data (a topic)\n3. **Basic LLM Chain** — sends a prompt to the AI and gets a response"

We recommend **OpenRouter** — it offers free models with no strict rate limits.\n\n### Option A: OpenRouter (Recommended)\n\n1. Go to [openrouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai/)\n2. Sign up (no credit card required for free models)\n3. Go to **Keys** → **Create Key**\n4. **Copy the API key** (starts with `sk-or-...`)\n\n**Add to n8n:**\n1. In n8n, click **Settings** (gear icon, bottom-left)\n2. Select **Credentials** → **Add Credential**\n3. Search for **\"OpenRouter\"**\n4. Paste your API key → **Save**\n\n### Option B: Google AI Studio (Free but limited)\n\n1. Go to [aistudio.google.com](https://aistudio.google.com/)\n2. Sign in with your Google account\n3. Click **Get API Key** → **Create API Key**\n4. **Copy the API key** (starts with `AIza...`)\n\n**Add to n8n:**\n1. In n8n, click **Settings** → **Credentials** → **Add Credential**\n2. Search for **\"Google Gemini\"**\n3. Paste your API key → **Save**\n\n**Note:** Google's free tier has strict daily limits (~20-50 requests/day).

In the text area, type:\n\n```\nExplain artificial intelligence as if I were 5 years old.\n```\n\nThis basic approach works. To make it dynamic, use the `topic` field from the Edit Fields node instead of hardcoding text.\n\n### Introducing Expressions\n\n**Expressions** let you use data from previous nodes. The syntax is:\n\n```\n{{ $json.fieldName }}\n```\n\nChange your prompt to:\n\n```\nExplain {{ $json.topic }} as if I were 5 years old.\n```\n\n**Important:** Make sure the field is in **Expression mode**. Click the toggle to switch from \"Fixed\" to \"Expression\":\n\n![Expression mode toggle](../images/expression_toggle.png)\n\n**What this does:** When the workflow runs, `{{ $json.topic }}` is replaced with `artificial intelligence` (the value from the Edit Fields node).",

In the Output panel, click the **pin icon** (📌)\n3. The node now shows a pin indicator\n\n**What this does:** Next time you run the workflow, this node will use the pinned data instead of calling the AI again. This:\n- Saves money (no API call)\n- Saves time (instant result)\n- Keeps your data consistent while you build downstream nodes\n\n**To unpin:** Click the pin icon again.\n\n**Pro tip:** Pin data after any expensive or slow operation (like AI calls) while you're building."

Run and see the result\n\n### Experiment 3: Add a System Message\n1. In the Basic LLM Chain, find **System Message**\n2.
