Start when you click a button\n2. Create some input data (a topic)\n3. Ask an AI to write a haiku about that topic\n\nLet's go!"

The syntax is:\n\n```\n{{ $json.fieldName }}\n```\n\nChange your prompt to:\n\n```\nWrite a haiku about {{ $json.topic }}.\n```\n\n**Important:** Make sure the field is in **Expression mode**.
