This appendix shows how to make them run automatically —\nand what to do when things go wrong.\n\n**When to read this:**\n- You've built workflows and want them to run on their own\n- You're about to share a workflow with someone (webhook URL, scheduled job)\n- You want to know what happens when a workflow fails"

In the real world, nobody clicks a button — workflows need to start on their own.\n\n**Activating a workflow** means flipping the toggle in the top-right corner of the editor from OFF to ON. Once activated, the workflow's trigger fires automatically (on a schedule, when a webhook receives data, etc.).\n\n### Execution Types\n\n| Type | When it runs | Where you see results |\n|------|-------------|------------------------|\n| **Manual** | You click \"Execute Workflow\" | Output Panel (live) |\n| **Production** | Trigger fires automatically | Execution History |\n\nTo see past production runs: **Left sidebar → Executions**."

To run them 24/7, you need n8n running on a server.\n\nThere are three main options:\n\n| Option | Cost | Setup time | You manage the server? |\n|--------|------|-----------|------------------------|\n| **n8n Cloud** | From ~€20/mo ([see pricing](https://n8n.io/pricing/)) | 2 min | No |\n| **Railway** | ~$5/mo minimum ([see pricing](https://railway.com/pricing)) | 5 min | No |\n| **VPS + Docker** | $4–12/mo | 30–60 min | Yes |\n\n### What Changes in Production\n\nWhen n8n runs on a server instead of your laptop, two things change:\n\n1. **Webhook URLs become public.** Your local `http://localhost:5678/webhook/...` becomes `https://your-domain.com/webhook/...` — accessible from anywhere.\n\n2. **Workflows must be activated.** The toggle in the top-right corner must be ON. Triggers (Schedule, Webhook, Chat) only fire in production when the workflow is active.\n\n### Hands-on Deployment\n\n**Project 4: Deploy to Production** walks you through deploying a workflow step by step — Railway (recommended for this course) and n8n Cloud. See [](project_4_deploy_to_production) for the full guide.\n\n### Going Further\n\n| Resource | Link |\n|----------|------|\n| n8n hosting options | [docs.n8n.io/hosting](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/) |\n| Docker Compose setup | [docs.n8n.io/hosting/installation/docker](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/installation/docker/) |\n| n8n Cloud | [n8n.io/cloud](https://n8n.io/cloud/) |\n| Railway n8n template | [railway.com/template/n8n](https://railway.com/template/n8n) |\n| Environment variables | [docs.n8n.io/hosting/configuration/environment-variables](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/) |"
