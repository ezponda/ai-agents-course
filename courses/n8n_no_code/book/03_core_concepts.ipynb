    "\n",
    "n8n passes data as a **list of items**. Each item is a JSON object:\n",
    "\n",
    "```json\n",
    "[\n",
    "  { \"topic\": \"coffee\", \"style\": \"funny\" },\n",
    "  { \"topic\": \"rain\", \"style\": \"sad\" }\n",
    "]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When a node receives 2 items, it processes each one and outputs 2 results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Input and Output\n",
    "\n",
    "Every node has:\n",
    "- **Input** — what it receives from the previous node\n",
    "- **Output** — what it sends to the next node\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "[Node A] ──output──▶ [Node B] ──output──▶ [Node C]\n",
    "              (input)             (input)\n",
