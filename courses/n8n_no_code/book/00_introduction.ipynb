By the end, you'll understand when to use a simple prompt, when to build a workflow, and when to deploy a full agent."

   "source": "---\n\n## Why AI Agents?\n\n**The problem:** Large Language Models (like GPT) are powerful, but limited:\n- They only produce text — they can't check facts or take real actions\n- One attempt — if they're wrong, you catch the error\n- Complex prompts often lead to errors and invented details\n\n**The solution:** AI Agents go beyond simple prompts:\n- They **use tools** (calculator, search, APIs) to get real information\n- They **loop** until the task is complete\n- They **decide** the next step based on results\n\n**Why n8n:** Visual, drag-and-drop interface. Perfect if you're not a programmer. You see exactly what's happening at each step.",

Each project is self-contained — pick whichever interests you.\n\n| Project | What you'll build |\n|---------|-------------------|\n| **Project 1: Recipe Assistant** | An agent that searches real APIs and delegates to sub-workflows |\n| **Project 2: Ask Your Data** | Ask natural-language questions about a Spotify dataset — the agent writes and runs Python code to answer them |\n\n### Appendices\n\nReference material to consult as needed — not meant to be read cover-to-cover.\n\n| Appendix | What it covers |\n|----------|----------------|\n| **A: Node Toolbox** | Every core node: parameters, output fields, common mistakes |\n| **B: Going Live** | Schedule triggers, webhooks, error handling, production checklist |\n| **C: Specialized AI Nodes** | Text Classifier, Sentiment Analysis, Information Extractor, and more |\n| **D: Prompt Engineering Basics** | 6 techniques to write better prompts |\n| **E: Prompt Engineering for Agents** | ReAct loop, tool descriptions, system prompt templates |\n| **F: Selected Resources** | Papers, courses, and guides for going deeper |"
