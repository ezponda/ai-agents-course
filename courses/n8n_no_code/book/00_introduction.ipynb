    "\n",
    "**n8n** (pronounced \"n-eight-n\") is a workflow automation platform. You build automations visually by connecting nodes on a canvas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it as a visual programming environment where:\n",
    "- Each **node** performs one action (call an API, transform data, make a decision)\n",
    "- **Connections** link nodes together\n",
    "- Data flows from left to right through the workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "n8n can be self-hosted (you run it on your computer or server) or used via n8n Cloud.\n",
    "\n",
    "**For this course, we use self-hosted n8n** so you have full control and can experiment freely."

    "## What is a Workflow?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **workflow** is a sequence of connected steps that automate a task.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key characteristics:\n",
    "- Workflows are **visual**: you see nodes on a canvas connected by lines\n",
    "- Every workflow has a **starting point** called a Trigger\n",
    "- Data flows **left-to-right** through connected nodes\n",
    "- Workflows can be saved, exported, and shared as JSON files\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example workflow structure:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Trigger → Set Data → LLM Call → Save Result\n",

    "## What is an Execution?\n",
    "\n",
    "An **execution** is one complete run of a workflow from trigger to end.\n",
    "\n",
    "- When you click \"Execute Workflow,\" you create one execution\n",
    "- Each execution has a unique ID and is logged\n",
    "- You can view past executions to debug problems\n",
    "- Executions show the data at each step, making it easy to trace what happened\n",
    "\n",
    "**In this course, you will run workflows in \"Test\" mode** (manual execution in the editor). This is different from \"Activated\" workflows that run automatically in production."

    "| Option | Description | Best for |\n",
    "|--------|-------------|----------|\n",
