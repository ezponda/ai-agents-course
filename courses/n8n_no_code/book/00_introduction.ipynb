   "source": "# Introduction to n8n\n\nn8n is a visual workflow automation tool. You connect nodes on a canvas, and data flows through them. No code required.\n\nThis course teaches you to build AI workflows—automations that call language models like GPT to process text, make decisions, and generate responses.\n\n**By the end, you will have built:**\n- A workflow that writes a memo in three steps (outline → edit → final draft)\n- A routing system that classifies support tickets and sends each to the right handler\n- An AI agent that can search Wikipedia, do math, and remember your conversation\n\nAll without writing a single line of code."

   "source": "---\n\n## How n8n Works\n\nYou build workflows by placing **nodes** on a canvas and connecting them with lines. Each node does one thing: fetch data, call an API, transform text, make a decision.\n\n```\n[Trigger] → [Get Data] → [Call AI] → [Save Result]\n```\n\nData flows left to right. When you run the workflow, each node executes in sequence.\n\nn8n can run on your computer (self-hosted) or in the cloud. This course uses the self-hosted version so you can experiment freely."

The Quick Start chapter has you building within the first few minutes."

To avoid unexpected charges:\n\n- Run workflows in **Test mode** (manual execution) while learning\n- Keep workflows **deactivated** until you're ready for production\n- Tools like Wikipedia and Calculator are free—no API key needed"
