    "\n",
    "**n8n** (pronounced \"n-eight-n\") is a workflow automation platform. You build automations visually by connecting nodes on a canvas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it as a visual programming environment where:\n",
    "- Each **node** performs one action (call an API, transform data, make a decision)\n",
    "- **Connections** link nodes together\n",
    "- Data flows from left to right through the workflow\n",

    "n8n can be self-hosted (you run it on your computer or server) or used via n8n Cloud.\n",
