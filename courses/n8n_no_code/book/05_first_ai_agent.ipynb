By the end, you will understand:\n\n- How to set up an AI Agent node\n- How to connect tools the agent can use\n- How the agent decides when to use tools\n- How to test and debug agent workflows\n\n**Prerequisites:**\n- n8n running locally\n- An API key for a chat model provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, OpenRouter, etc.)\n- A SerpAPI key for web search (free tier available)\n\n---"

Provides a summarized answer\n\n**Example interaction:**\n\n- **Input:** \"What is the current price of Bitcoin?\"\n- **Agent thinks:** \"I need current data\" → searches the web\n- **Output:** \"As of today, Bitcoin is trading at approximately [current price from search results]...\"\n\n---"

    "### Agent Keeps Calling Tools Forever\n",

    "\n",
    "**Cause:** The question does not require external data, or the system message discourages tool use.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fix:** Ask questions that clearly need current information:\n",
    "```\n",
    "What is the weather in Tokyo right now?\n",

    "\n",
    "### Credential Errors\n",
