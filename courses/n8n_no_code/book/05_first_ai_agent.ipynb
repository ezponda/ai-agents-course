Calls the tool and reads results\n4. Provides a summarized answer\n\n**Example interaction:**\n\n- **Input:** \"What is the square root of 144?\"\n- **Agent thinks:** \"I need to calculate this\" → calls Calculator tool\n- **Output:** \"The square root of 144 is 12.\"\n\n---"

This enables multi-turn conversations where the agent can reference earlier context.\n\nTo add memory:\n1. Click the AI Agent node\n2. Find the **Memory** sub-node connector\n3. Add **Simple Memory** (or Window Buffer Memory)\n4. Set a unique **Session ID** if you want separate conversation threads\n\n### Use Chat Trigger for Multi-Turn Conversations\n\n**Recommended for memory demos:** Replace Manual Trigger with **Chat Trigger** to get a proper chat interface. See workflow `07_ai_agent_chat_trigger_memory.json`.\n\nNote: Chat Trigger must connect directly to an agent or chain root node.\n\n### Add More Tools\n\nConnect additional tools so the agent can:\n- **Wikipedia:** Look up factual information\n- **Calculator:** Perform math operations\n- **HTTP Request:** Call specific APIs\n- **Code Tool:** Run custom JavaScript logic\n\n---"
