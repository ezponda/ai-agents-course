Unlike Basic LLM Chain (which runs once), the AI Agent can loop: call a tool, read the result, then decide to call another tool or finish.\n\n### How It Differs from Basic LLM Chain\n\n| Feature | Basic LLM Chain | AI Agent |\n|---------|-----------------|----------|\n| **Execution** | Single call | Loop until done |\n| **Tools** | None | Can use HTTP, Code, Search, etc. |\n| **Decision-making** | You control flow | Agent decides what to do |\n| **Complexity** | Simple | More powerful, less predictable |\n\n**When to use AI Agent:** When the task requires multiple steps that the AI should figure out on its own.\n\n**When to use Basic LLM Chain:** When you know exactly what the AI should do (most workflows).\n\n### Key Parameters\n\n| Parameter | Description |\n|-----------|-------------|\n| **Agent Type** | How the agent reasons (Tools Agent is most common) |\n| **System Message** | Instructions for the agent's behavior |\n| **Chat Model** | Connection to a Chat Model provider (dotted line) |\n| **Tools** | Nodes the agent can invoke (dotted line connections) |\n\n### How the Loop Works\n\n1. Agent receives your prompt\n2. Agent decides: \"I need more information\" → calls a tool\n3. Tool returns data\n4. Agent decides: \"Now I can answer\" → outputs final response\n5. (Or: \"I need another tool\" → back to step 2)\n\n### Example: Search and Summarize\n\n**Goal:** User asks a question, agent searches the web, then summarizes results.\n\n**Setup:**\n- AI Agent node with system message: \"Answer questions by searching when needed. Summarize your findings.\"\n- Connected tool: SerpAPI (web search) or HTTP Request node\n- Connected model: OpenAI Chat Model\n\n**What happens:**\n1. User prompt: \"What are the latest AI regulations in the EU?\"\n2. Agent thinks: \"I need current information\" → calls search tool\n3. Search returns results\n4. Agent thinks: \"I have enough info\" → writes summary\n5. Output: `{ \"output\": \"Based on my search, here is what I found...\" }`\n\n### Output\n\nThe agent's final response appears in the `output` field:\n\n```json\n{ \"output\": \"Based on my search, here is what I found...\" }\n```\n\n### Common Mistake\n\n**Not defining tool boundaries.** Without clear instructions, agents may call tools unnecessarily or get stuck in loops. Be specific about when to use each tool.\n\n**Docs:** [AI Agent Node](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/)",
